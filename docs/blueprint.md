## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Professional Navy (#002147) for a professional, reliable feel. The saturation is around 50%, and brightness 15%.
- Background color: A desaturated navy (#E0E5EC), light enough for contrast against the primary Navy.
- Accent color: Support Blue (#4F46E5), brighter and more saturated than the Professional Navy, for vibrant highlights and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for high readability and a modern look.
- Implement clean grids and rounded cards, inspired by the Unifato eSoft template.

    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure prioritizes security and scalability for the ServanaAI Landing application by adhering to the core design principles. It focuses on authorization independence, clarity, and predictable schema.\n\nAuthorization Independence:  The structure avoids `get()` calls in security rules by denormalizing authorization data where needed.  In this application, all user data is private, stored under `/users/{userId}`.  No collaborative data scenarios requiring denormalization of membership maps are present.\n\nStructural Segregation: Each collection maintains a homogeneous security posture. User-specific data is stored under their respective user ID.\n\nAccess Modeling: The structure uses path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}/...`) for private user data.  This makes security rules straightforward, based solely on `request.auth.uid`.\n\nData Clarity and Predictability:  The schema is explicit and predictable."
